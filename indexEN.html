        <h1> About me: </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                I was born in a family that liked technology, so, when the opportunity arised for me to choose my
                professional area, I obviouslly chose the opposite path...
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Matheus Farina and I am 27 years old, years in witch I had the opportunity to work with
                Journalism and Social Communication, Marketing and analog games, fast food attendant, studied Gastronomy
                and had the opportunity to work in professional Kitchens alongside renowed chefs.
                All of that gave me the experience to make me who I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I turned my attention to tech again, I was simply in awe with how much I fell in love for it.
                Developing and programing became a new hobby and soon turned to a passion, with the difference that the
                developing world could be a new carreer for me.
                So, I started the Generation Brazil Java Fullstack Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I am a Tech student, and i plan to never stop being one.
                Discovering new programing languages and technologies, learning how they can interact and change the
                world around me, and change my own history with it.
                This page is but a small step in the start of this journey, care to join me?
